# ImageCompressor
Hello, It's Coalyni34. This is just a program for simple work with images.
## How does it actually work?
The program gets your image and settings which you send to it, and then it decompiles this image and remake it.
The Image Compressor decodes an image to the binary code, then it compiles it again, but now with your own settings.
You can read the code and the inteface of my program is very simple.
## Quick-start
